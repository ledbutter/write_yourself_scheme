# write_yourself_scheme

This is my attempt at following along with [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).

It is purely for fun and to get some real exposure to Haskell (and further my understanding of Scheme as encountered in [SICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs#:~:text=Structure%20and%20Interpretation%20of%20Computer%20Programs%20(SICP)%20is%20a%20computer,Wizard%20Book%22%20in%20hacker%20culture.)).
